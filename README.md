### Intent & How it's made

The intent and purpose of this portfolio is to showcase

the intent and purpose behind this website was to build functional site, employing working knowledge of several important technologies, in order to design an online presence for myself as a future developer. Consquently, this portfolio was made utilising the following technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **SASS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Netlify**

Further more, this site will be worked on, improved, and returned too over again in order to also serve as a repository for completed & future projects. My hope is that this will also illustrate my passions, interests, but importantly, my tech related work and skills.

In doing so, I followed and modelled this site off the [following tutorial](https://youtu.be/xV7S8BhIeBo) from FreeCodeCamp's YouTube page. An attempt was made to initially mirror the existing code base, following the tutorial's lead. After working through the tutorial, greater liberty was taken to expand beyond what was covered, and the following features were subsequently added to the site:

- **List features**
-
-

### Functionality

- add notes for functionality

### Optimisations

- ..
- One central limitation was the minimal implementation of JavaScript. I intend to remedy this problem with future implementation of features with later iterations of the website. Some of which include reviewing Brad Traversy's [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://50projects50days.com/) course in order to implement some of the features covered. Additionally, a future iteration includes the implementation of a JS framework - such as React -, allowing for a wider breath of technologies to be explored and utilised.

### Lessons Learned

- ...
- This was an important opportunity to revisit some lost familiarity with CSS & SASS, though I feel the implemention of JavaScript was minimal. I discussed above in Optimisations where I feel improvements could be made in order to use JS to improve the functionality of the site.
