### Intent & How it's made

This portfolio was made utilising the following technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **SASS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Netlify**

In doing so, I followed and modelled this site off the [following tutorial](https://youtu.be/xV7S8BhIeBo) from FreeCodeCamp's YouTube page

### Functionality

### Optimisations

- ..
- ..
- Include more JS: Brad's projects and bring in a JS framework (possibly React)

### Lessons Learned

- ...
- ...
- This was an important opportunity to revisit some lost familiarity with CSS & SASS, though I feel the implemention of JavaScript was minimal. I discussed above in Optimisations where I feel improvements could be made in order to use JS to improve the functionality of the site.
