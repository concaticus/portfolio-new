### Intent & How it's made

This portfolio was made utilising the following technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **SASS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Netlify**

In doing so, I followed and modelled this site off the [following tutorial](https://youtu.be/xV7S8BhIeBo) from FreeCodeCamp's YouTube page

### Functionality

### Optimisations

- ..
- One central limitation was the minimal implementation of JavaScript. I intend to remedy this problem with future implementation of features with later iterations of the website. Some of which include reviewing Brad Traversy's [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://50projects50days.com/) course in order to implement some of the features covered. Additionally, a future iteration includes the implementation of a JS framework - such as React -, allowing for a wider breath of technologies to be explored and utilised.

### Lessons Learned

- ...
- ...
- This was an important opportunity to revisit some lost familiarity with CSS & SASS, though I feel the implemention of JavaScript was minimal. I discussed above in Optimisations where I feel improvements could be made in order to use JS to improve the functionality of the site.
